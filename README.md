# Django, Webpack & React notes

These are my own notes for how to get React, Django
and Webpack to work together in order to set up a
React front end and Django back end.

**Warning**: If you're developing something like
this, please don't just follow my example.  I'm
not creating this set of notes as 'the right way',
but rather, this is me figuring this out.

Help is welcome.

# My own notes on using React as a front end for my projects

## Starting point

Here is the problem where I started.  I know Django fairly
well, and have used it for a number of projects over the
years.  I also know JavaScript rather well, as well as
HTML and CSS.  I'm new to React, but I've dipped my toes
into some online tutorials and I've read some docs, etc.

I want to create an 'app', as per the Django parlance that
I hope to package as a single git repo, and so ideally I'd
like to keep as much of the code within the project.

Since this is for me, I'm not going to explain anything
that I already know.  As a result, it might be a bit
starting from nowhere if you happen to stumble across this
repo in your attempts to solve a similar problem.
